\usage{
install_imfeatures_python(
  envname = "r-imfeatures",
  method = ifelse(.detect_conda_present(), "conda", "virtualenv"),
  python_version = "3.9",
  install_thingsvision = TRUE,
  install_resmem = TRUE,
  force_create = FALSE,
  conda_path = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{envname}{The name for the Python environment. Defaults to "r-imfeatures".
If using venv, this can also be a path.}

\item{method}{The method to create the environment, either "conda" or "virtualenv".
Defaults to "conda" if available, otherwise "virtualenv".}

\item{python_version}{The Python version to install in the environment (e.g., "3.9").
Defaults to "3.9". Ensure this version is compatible with dependencies.}

\item{install_thingsvision}{Logical. Install the 'thingsvision' library? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{install_resmem}{Logical. Install the 'resmem' library? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{force_create}{Logical. If TRUE, an existing environment with the same name
will be removed before creating the new one. Use with caution! Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{conda_path}{Path to the conda executable. Defaults to reticulate's auto-detection.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path or name of the created environment.
}
\description{
This function creates a dedicated Python environment (using Conda or venv)
named "r-imfeatures" and installs the necessary Python packages required
by the imfeatures R package, namely Pillow, and optionally thingsvision and resmem.
}
\details{
This function requires either Miniconda/Anaconda (for method="conda") or a
standard Python installation (for method="virtualenv") to be available.
Installation can take a significant amount of time depending on the packages selected.

After successful installation, it's recommended to restart your R session.
The package will attempt to automatically configure reticulate to use the
"r-imfeatures" environment upon loading.
