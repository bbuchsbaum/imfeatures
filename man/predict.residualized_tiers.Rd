\title{Predict method for residualized_tiers}
\usage{
\method{predict}{residualized_tiers}(object, newdata, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{residualized_tiers}.}

\item{newdata}{A named list of new feature matrices, structured identically to the
\code{feature_list} used to train the \code{object}. Each matrix must
have the same number of columns (features) as its corresponding training matrix,
and all matrices in \code{newdata} must have the same number of rows (samples).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not currently used).}
}
\value{
A named list of residualized PC score matrices for the new data.
        The structure matches \code{object$residuals}.
}
\description{
Applies a trained residualized_tiers transformation to new data.
For each tier in the new data:
1. PCA is applied using the PCA model from the training phase for that tier.
2. The resulting PC scores for the current tier are then residualized against
   the (non-residualized) PC scores of all *preceding tiers from the new data*.
This ensures the same hierarchical orthogonalization logic is applied.
