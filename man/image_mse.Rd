\title{Multiscale entropy for images}
\usage{
image_mse(im, sf = c(100, 50, 8, 4, 0), bins = 16)
}
\arguments{
\item{im}{image of type `cimg` from `imager` package. The function expects an
image with three colour channels. If a single-channel image is supplied it will
be converted with \code{add.colour()}, and an error is thrown if the result does
not contain exactly three channels.}

\item{sf}{vector smoothing factors indicating the scales for entropy computation}

\item{bins}{number of bins for computing information}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with the mean multiscale entropy for the \code{H},
\code{S} and \code{V} channels.
